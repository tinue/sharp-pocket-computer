# Software and other material about Sharp Pocket Computers

## Sharp Communicator
If you have a Sharp PC-1500 or PC-1600 with a serial interface, then this software allows to
exchange Basic programs between a PC and the Pocket PC. The software is written in Java,
and works whenever a Java VM 17 or later is available (PC, Mac, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

See the [README.md](SharpCommunicator/README.md) of the project for details.

## Other material
The directories under `sharp-software` contain material that I found elsewhere. The Basic programs
are not written by me, and are probably copyrighted by other people. Please contact me if
you are the author of an application, and want it to be removed, or if you want to be credited.
