# Scripts
This folder contains helper scripts. They are not part of the software itself, and only help in building or releasing it.

- build.zsh: Builds the software, and copies the resulting jar file to convenient locations (needs to be adapter for each user)
- makerelease: Uses Github CLI to create a release or pre-release.
